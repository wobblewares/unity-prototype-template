# README #

# VFX pack to add the familiar wobble style to your own projects! #
* Compatible with the Unity Game Engine, this asset provides shaders and fonts to apply the wobble style across your project.

---
# Lots of different effects! #
* A variety of effects are implemented in the distinct wobble style including wobblefont, wobbleshadow, wobbleui, toonwobble and wobbleflipbook. These effects can be synchronised to get a uniform wobble across your entire game.
---

# Support for multiple pipelines and text systems! #
* Every shader comes with a version for both the built-in and universal render pipelines and wobble font comes with versions for both the Legacy and TextMeshPro* systems.


  (IMPORTANT NOTE: There's a specific bug in TMP 3.0.6 that seems to cause issues in some Unity versions. Upgrading to TextMeshPro 3.2.0-pre.4 or above will fix the issue)

---

# Adjust wobble speed, amount and frames! #
* Each shader allows you to adjust how many 'wobbles' occur per second, how large the randomised offset is, and how many 'unique' frames of wobble animation occur.
---

# The boring stuff! #
* You can use this asset in personal or commercial projects
* You can edit the assets freely, but cannot repackage, resell or redistribute them in any way.
* Credit is not necessary but you can provide a link to my itch page if you want!
